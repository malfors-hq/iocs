# Russian Intelligence Service-linked Phishing Campaign

Russian intelligence-linked actor runs a campaign to impersonate [the CIA](https://www.cia.gov/), [Freedom of Russia Legion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Russia_Legion),
[Russian Volunteer Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Volunteer_Corps), and [I Want To Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Want_to_Live_(hotline)). 
The campaign targets Russian citizens who support Ukraine and want to share intelligence with the CIA.

In collaboration with [SilentPush](https://www.silentpush.com), we identified more than 60 malicious domains. The campaign remains active as of May 2025. The list of indicators will be updated as soon as we discover them.
